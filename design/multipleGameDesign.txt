When a user logs in, he currently automatically joins a game.

Instead, the user should join a games lobby where he sees a chat, a button to create a new game, all created games and  how many people have joined each one.

The first step in this process is to create a separate Game class that just holds a list of players and lets them join and quit and slightly modify the gui.

There should be a new LOBBY state the player goes to after logging in, which lets him create a game and view all created games. There should also be a button to let him go to the current "global" game.

The client only has one game object, which is the game the client is currently in (or MILL if the client is in the lobby). The mapGames of the client maps game names to number of players in each game.
